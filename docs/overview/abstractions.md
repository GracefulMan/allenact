# Primary abstractions

Our package relies on a collection of fundamental abstractions to define a reinforcement learning problem. These
abstractions are described in plain language below. Each of the below sections end with a link to the 
(formal) documentation of the abstraction as well as a link to an example implementation of the abstract (if relevant).

## Task
 
See the [abstract Task class](/api/rl_base/task/#task) and an [example implementation](/api/extensions/ai2thor/tasks/#objectnavtask).

## Actor critic model [(link)](/api/onpolicy_sync/policy/#actorcriticmodel)
