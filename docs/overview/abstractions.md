# Primary abstractions

Our package relies on a collection of fundamental abstractions to define a reinforcement learning problem. These
abstractions are described in plain language below. Each of the below sections end with a link to the 
(formal) documentation of the abstraction as well as a link to an example implementation of the abstract (if relevant).

## Task

Tasks define the scope of the interaction between agents and an environment (including the action types agents are 
allowed to execute), as well as metrics to evaluate the agents' performance. For example, we might define a task 
`ObjectNavTask` in which agents receive observations obtained from the environment (e.g. RGB images) or directly from 
the task (e.g. a target object class) and are allowed to execute actions such as `move forward`, `turn right`, 
`turn_left`, and `done` whenever agents determine they have reached their target. The metrics might include a
success indicator or some quantitative metric on the optimality of the followed path.  
 
See the [abstract `Task` class](/api/rl_base/task/#task) 
and an [example implementation](/api/extensions/ai2thor/tasks/#objectnavtask).

## Sensor

Sensors provide observations extracted from an environment (e.g. RGB or depth images) or directly from a task (e.g. the 
end point in point navigation or target object class in semantic navigation) that can be either directly consumed by 
agents or processed by a [preprocessor](#preprocessor). 

See the [abstract `Sensor` class](/api/rl_base/sensor/#sensor) 
and an [example implementation](/api/extensions/ai2thor/tasks/#objectnavtask).

## Task sampler

A task sampler is responsible for generating a sequence of tasks for agents to solve. The sequence of tasks can be 
randomly generated (e.g. in training) or extracted from an ordered pool (e.g. in validation or testing).

See the [abstract `TaskSampler` class](/api/rl_base/task/#tasksampler) 
and an [example implementation](/api/extensions/ai2thor/task_samplers/#objectnavtasksampler).

## Actor critic model

The actor-critic agent is responsible for computing batched action probabilities and state values given the 
observations provided by sensors or preprocessors, internal state representations, previous actions, and potentially 
other inputs.

See the [abstract `ActorCriticModel` class](/api/onpolicy_sync/policy/#actorcriticmodel) 
and an [example implementation](/api/extensions/ai2thor/task_samplers/#objectnavtasksampler).

## Actor critic loss

Actor-critic losses compute a combination of action loss and value loss out of collected experience that can be used to 
train actor-critic models with back-propagation, e.g. PPO or A2C.

See the [abstract `AbstractActorCriticLoss` class](/api/onpolicy_sync/policy/#actorcriticmodel) 
and an [example implementation](/api/onpolicy_sync/losses/ppo/#ppo).

## Rollout storage

Rollout storage is used to store observations, internal states, actions and rewards resulting from the interaction of 
actor-critic models with tasks running in parallel.

See the [`RolloutStorage` class](/api/onpolicy_sync/storage/#rolloutstorage).
