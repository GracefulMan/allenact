    TaskSampler at a time and this class allows for interacting with these
    tasks in a vectorized manner. When a task on a process completes, the
    process samples another task from its task sampler. All the tasks are
    synchronized (for step and new_task methods).

    Attributes:
        make_sampler_fn: function which creates a single TaskSampler.
        sampler_fn_args: sequence of dictionaries describing the args
            to pass to make_sampler_fn on each individual process.
        auto_resample_when_done: automatically sample a new Task from the TaskSampler when
            the Task completes. If False, a new Task will not be resampled until all
            Tasks on all processes have completed. This functionality is provided for seamless training
            of vectorized Tasks.
        multiprocessing_start_method: the multiprocessing method used to
            spawn worker processes. Valid methods are
            ``{'spawn', 'forkserver', 'fork'}`` ``'forkserver'`` is the
            recommended method as it works well with CUDA. If
            ``'fork'`` is used, the subproccess  must be started before
            any other GPU useage.
